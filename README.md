# PUBGLiveMatchStat

This Google Script Code collect and show the streamer PUBG Stats from the actual stream. You can use the code with or without modification.

# How it works?
First of all, you need to create a Twitch APP becouse of you need a Twitch APP Client ID. You need to create a PUBG API account and register a new app for the PUBG API APP TOKEN. You need to indendify your or your favorited streamer Twitch UserID and PUBG account name.

You can get the Streamer UserID with this Twitch API endpoint: https://api.twitch.tv/helix/users?login=username
In my code i'm not implemented it becouse of the extra runtime due to this fetch.

If you finished the earlier steps above, you need to creat a new Google Script project and copy-paste the PUBGLiveStatMatch_Google_Script.js content to it and have to fill with this information the script and Deploy as a webapp. 

You got a link at the end. You have to paste it this link into the right place in PUBGStatFetch.html.

Later I create or search a tutorial how to do this.
